Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
When simulation numbers are below 1000, the simulations don't even show all the teams.
At 1000 simulations, the simulations show all the teams but the results are not consisitent. 

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
10000, because the prediction results are more consisitent.
